Photon is a lightning fast web crawler which extracts URLs, files, intel & endpoints from a target.

160 requests per second while extensive data extraction is just another day for Photon!

## Main Features

#### Data Extraction
Photon extracts the following data while crawling by default:

- URLs (in-scope & out-of-scope)
- URLs with parameters (`example.com/gallery.php?id=2`)
- Intel (emails, social media accounts, amazon buckets etc.)
- Files (pdf, png, xml etc.)
- JavaScript files & Endpoints present in them
- Strings based on custom regex pattern

The extracted information is saved in an organized manner.\

Photon also allows custom data extraction with [regex patterns](https://github.com/s0md3v/Photon/wiki/Usage#custom-regex-pattern).

#### Intelligent Multithreading
Here's a secret, most of the tools floating on the internet aren't properly multi-threaded even if they are supposed to. They either supply a list of items to threads which results in multiple threads accessing the same item or they simply put a thread lock and end up rendering multi-threading useless.\
But Photon is different or should I say "genius"? Take a look at [this](https://github.com/s0md3v/Photon/blob/8b58580df1bdfe5f7b96eaf83957d018418ec8ae/photon.py#L357-L381) and decide yourself.

#### Ninja Mode
In Ninja Mode, 3 online services are used to make requests to the target on your behalf.\
So basically, now you have 4 clients making requests to the same server simultaneously which gives you a speed boost if you have a slow connection, minimizes the risk of connection reset as well as delays requests from a single client.\

#### Plugins
Photon's capabilites can be further extended by using plugins.

Available plugins:

- **[dnsdumpster](https://github.com/s0md3v/Photon/wiki/Usage#dumping-dns-data)**: Generates an image containing the DNS data of the target domain.
- **[Exporter](https://github.com/s0md3v/Photon/wiki/Usage#export-formatted-result)**: Plugin to export results in JSON, support for more formats is being developed.

Plugins in active development:

- **Quark**: A plugin to plot a graph making it easier to inspect relationships between different webpages using [Quark](https://github.com/s0md3v/Quark).
- **dnsdumpster**: A new version of the plugin is in development which will save the DNS data in a nicely formatted HTML file.

#### Support
The project is under heavy development and any submitted issues or pull requests will be acknowledged within min 5 minutes and max 9 hours.
